# sequences

# solution1
The solution_1.cpp file contains the simplest solution to the problem

# solution2
The solution_2.cpp file contains the primary check function with simple cache mechanism, if function check prime number that previously was checked then cache mechanism give result

# solution3
solution 3 has a caching buffer and additionally checks if the number is the first using the mechanism of parallelization calculations using the OpenMP library

# solution4
solution 4 has a caching buffer and additionally checks if the number is the first using the mechanism of parallelization calculations using the pthread library
